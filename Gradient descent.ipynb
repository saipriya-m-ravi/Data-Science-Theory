Basic idea is to tweak parameters iteratively in order to minimize a cost function.\n","\n","-> It start by filling theta with random values (random initialization). It computes the gradient of cost function with regard to each model parameter theta_j and it goes in the direction of descending gradient. Once gradient is zero, we've reached the minimum.\n","\n","-> We need to calculate how much the cost function will change if we change theta_j just a little bit. Its called partial derivative.\n","\n","-> Size of steps is determined by learning rate hyperparameter. Learning step size is proportional to the slope of cost function so the steps gradually gets smaller as the cost approaches the minimum. If learning rate is too small , algo has to go through many iterations to converge which will take long time. If learning rate is too high algorithm diverges with larger and larger values failing to find a good solution.\n","\n","-> Convergence will become difficult if cost function graph has holes,ridges,plateaus (basically irregular terrain). Sometimes it will converge to a local minimum. Sometimes it take very long time to cross plateau and if we stop early, we will never reach global minimum.\n","\n","-> MSE cost function for linear regression is a convex function. That means if we pick any 2 points on the curve, the line segment joining them is never below the curve. That means there's no local minima and just one global minimum. Its a continous function with a slope that never changes abruptly. So gradient descent is guranteed to approach global minimum.\n","\n","-> When using gradient descent all features should have similar scale. Otherwise it will take much longer to converge.\n","\n","-> Training a model means seraching for a combination of model parameters that minimizes the cost function.

Here cost function will bounce up and down decreasing only average. Over time it will end up close to minima but even after that it will bounce around, never settling down. When algorithm stops, final parameter values will be good but not optimal.\n","\n","When cost function is irregular, it helps to jump out of local minima so SGD has better chance of finding global minima than batch GD.
